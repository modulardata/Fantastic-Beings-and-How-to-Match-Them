<h5 id="description">Description</h5>
<p>Our game is already playable — it challenges a player; they can win or lose. Let's add another layer of magic and fill our program with sounds and animations.</p>
<p>At the final stage, add sound clips for selecting a creature and the disappearance of matched creatures. Also, add animations when the cursor hovers over creatures and when creatures disappear.</p>

<p></p><div class="alert alert-warning">We have prepared sounds and frames — make sure you've downloaded this <a href="https://stepik.org/media/attachments/lesson/652720/soundsanimation.zip" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">archive</a>.</div>
<p> </p>
<ul>
<li>Play <em>click.wav</em> when a player selects a creature. Do not play this when a player clicks on non-adjacent cells;</li>
<li>Increase the picture size of a creature by 10% when a player hovers over it. The transformation should take 500 milliseconds;</li>
<li>Play <em>match.wav</em> when the matched creatures disappear;</li>
<li>Add an animation from keyframes when a creature disappears. The animation duration is 800 milliseconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The points above are only wishes and ideas for witchcraft! You can add any other effects that come to your mind to your game, because this is a bonus stage :)</p>
